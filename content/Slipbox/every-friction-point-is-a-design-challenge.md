> Rather than bemoaning the way that things currently are, it's more productive to think of each friction point as a design challenge. 

## Definitions
### **Friction** 
Any and every thing that's not ideal. Ex. dissatisfaction at work, not exercising enough, etc.

### **Design** 
Changing attitudes, rearrange schedules, etc.

## Central Tenet
Unsatisfactory circumstances are not immutable. There's always something within my [[circles-of-influence|circle of influence]] I can tweak.

## Corollary
In practice, this would look like actively exploring the root cause of unsatisfactory state of affairs and identifying levers that I can "pull" to change it.  

## Implication
:::{.margin}
The slippery slope is falling into toxic positivity. I've burned myself out with the plucky attitude that if I just tried harder, be more positive, I will achieve something.
:::

This forces me to confront the gap between my complaining and my unwillingness to act. When I feel stuck, it's often not because the problem is intractable—it's because I'm not willing to do what would change it.

## Practice
I will stop complaining and start looking for what I can change.

For example, I feel bad that I don't exercise enough. I can blame it on the fact that I have a toddler and a full-time job, but it's really that I either feel selfish for asking for the time to exercise when I could be helping out with the housework or that I'm waiting to feel motivated to exercise, which likely will almost never happen. To design *around* the realities of my daily life and my current (reluctant) feelings about exercising, I can
- Schedule my 30min workout session at times that least impact the schedules of people around me, more so for my own mental comfort
- Pay extra attention to how I feel after a workout session, to start seeing it as something with immediate reward, rather than to chase a fitness goal far off in the future

## Bridge / Translation
The cost of ignoring this is that we will be floundering in inaction and feelings of victimization.
